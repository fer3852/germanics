    <GenericName>Germanic Spearman</GenericName>
    <History>"Swords or broad lances are seldom used; but they generally carry a spear, (called in their language "framea",) [...] that, as occasion requires, they employ [...] either in close or distant fighting."\nTacitus, De Origine et situ Germanorum, 98 CE.</History>
    <Tooltip>The spear was the main weapon of the Germanic tribes, with swords being too expensive for the bulk of their forces. Their short and agile spears were still a force to reckon though.</Tooltip>
