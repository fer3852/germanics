    <History>"[Their horses aren't] taught the various evolutions practised with us. The cavalry either bear down straight forward, or wheel once to the right, in so compact a body that none is left behind the rest."\nTacitus, De Origine et situ Germanorum, 98 CE.</History>
    <Tooltip>Like a sword, a horse was quite expenive and as a result cavalry was generally reserved to the rich. Nevertheless, the Germanic horsemanship had a high level as evidenced by the Romans who used Germanic soldiers for many of their elite cavalry forces.</Tooltip>
