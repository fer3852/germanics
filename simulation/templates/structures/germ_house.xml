    <History>"That none of the several people in Germany live together in cities, is abundantly known; nay, that amongst them none of their dwellings are suffered to be contiguous. They inhabit apart and distinct, just as a fountain, or a field, or a wood happened to invite them to settle."\nTacitus, De Origine et situ Germanorum, 98 CE.</History>
    <Tooltip>The Germanics lived in longhouses, together with their extended family and cattle.\nIncrease the population limit and recruit women and cattle.</Tooltip>
