There, they met the Romans as both civilisations tried to subdue the Gauls. After a series of bloody conflicts, culminating in the infamous Battle of Teutoburg Forest, both sides would eventually settle on the Rhine as border.",

He was raised as a Roman nobleman, and around 8 CE returned to his homeland as an army officer under the general Varus. When he witnessed Varus' harsh rule of his tribe, he made the decision to defect and drive the Romans out. Pretending to still be a loyal officer, he lured Varus' legions into an ambush in the Teutoburg forest, where he mercilessly slaughtered them."

Where Arminius advocated independence from the Romans, Segestes saw the economic advantages of a good relationship with Rome. After he failed to warn the general Varus of Arminius' revolt, he spent over a decade warring his son-in-law until the latter was murdered in 21 CE. Segestes eventually died peacefully as a Roman citizen."
